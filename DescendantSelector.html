descendant selector

ChatGPT said:
A descendant selector in CSS targets elements that are nested inside other elements, no matter how deeply, as long as they are descendants in the HTML hierarchy.

âœ… Syntax:
css
Copy
Edit
ancestor descendant {
  property: value;
}
The first part (ancestor) is the parent or ancestor element.

The second part (descendant) is the element inside it (child, grandchild, etc.).

ðŸ§¾ Example:
css
Copy
Edit
div p {
  color: blue;
}
This means any <p> element that is inside a <div> (could be a direct child or nested deeper) will have blue text.

Example HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<div>
  <p>This paragraph is blue.</p>
  <section>
    <p>This paragraph is also blue (nested inside div).</p>
  </section>
</div>

<p>This paragraph is NOT blue (not inside div).</p>
Difference from Child Selector (>):
Descendant selector matches any level deep.

Child selector matches only immediate children.

css
Copy
Edit
div > p {
  color: red; /* only direct child <p> of <div> */
}
Summary:
Descendant selector = space between selectors

Matches all descendants, no matter how deep
