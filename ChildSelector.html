child Selector

ChatGPT said:
A child selector in CSS targets elements that are direct children of a specific parent — not deeper nested descendants.

✅ Syntax:
css
Copy
Edit
parent > child {
  property: value;
}
The > means “direct child only.”

🧾 Example:
css
Copy
Edit
ul > li {
  color: red;
}
This targets only <li> elements that are immediate children of a <ul>.

🧱 Example HTML:
html
Copy
Edit
<ul>
  <li>Red item</li> <!-- matched -->
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Not red (nested too deep)</li> <!-- not matched -->
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
🔄 Compare with Descendant Selector:
css
Copy
Edit
ul li {
  color: red;
}
This would match all <li> elements inside <ul>, at any depth — including nested ones.

Summary:
Selector	Matches
ul > li	Only direct children <li> inside <ul>
ul li	All <li> inside <ul>, even nested ones
