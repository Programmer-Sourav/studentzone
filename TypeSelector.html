A type selector in CSS is a basic selector that targets HTML elements by their tag name (also called the element name).

‚úÖ Syntax:
css
Copy
Edit
element {
  property: value;
}
üßæ Example:
css
Copy
Edit
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
This applies the style to all <p> elements on the page.

üí° More Examples:
css
Copy
Edit
h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

button {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}
These target all <h1> and <button> tags respectively.

üîÅ Common Use:
Type selectors are often used for base styling, like:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
Type selectors are not as specific as class (.class) or ID (#id) selectors.

They can be combined with other selectors:

css
Copy
Edit
div p {
  color: red; /* targets <p> inside <div> */
}
