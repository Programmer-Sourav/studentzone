flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-wrap, flex:1

Great! You're diving into Flexbox, a powerful layout system in CSS. Letâ€™s break down the terms you're asking about: flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-wrap, and flex: 1.

ðŸ”§ 1. flex-basis
Defines the initial size of a flex item before any remaining space is distributed.

Can be set in px, %, em, etc.

Example:
css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  flex-basis: 200px;
}
ðŸ“Œ This tells the item to be 200px wide (or tall) before flex-grow or shrink is applied.

ðŸ”§ 2. flex-grow
Controls how much a flex item can grow relative to its siblings when thereâ€™s extra space.

Example:
css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  flex-grow: 2;
}
ðŸ“Œ This item will grow twice as much as an item with flex-grow: 1.

ðŸ”§ 3. flex-wrap
Tells the container whether to allow items to wrap to the next line if they donâ€™t fit.

Example:
css
Copy
Edit
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
ðŸ“Œ Items will go to a new line instead of squishing into one row.

ðŸ”§ 4. flex: 1
This is shorthand for:

css
Copy
Edit
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0%;
So:

css
Copy
Edit
.item {
  flex: 1;
}
ðŸ“Œ The item will:

Grow to fill the container (equal share with others that have flex: 1)

Shrink if necessary

Start from a base size of 0

ðŸ§  Quick Summary Table:
Property	Purpose
flex-basis	Initial size before growing/shrinking
flex-grow	How much item can grow (proportionally)
flex-wrap	Whether items wrap to next line
flex: 1	Shorthand: grow (1), shrink (1), basis (0%)
